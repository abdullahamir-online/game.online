            <p><strong>Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors!</strong> This classic game is easy to learn and fun to play. Follow the simple steps below to get started:</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The goal of the game is to choose a hand gesture (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) that beats the one chosen by the computer. Here’s how the gestures compare:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rock</strong> crushes <strong>Scissors</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Scissors</strong> cut <strong>Paper</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Paper</strong> covers <strong>Rock</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start the Game:</strong> As you access the game interface it is considered to be started automatically.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Choose Your Gesture:</strong> Select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking on the corresponding button.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Computer’s Gesture:</strong> The computer will randomly choose its own gesture.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Determine the Winner:</strong> The game will automatically compare your choice with the computer’s choice and display the result:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Win:</strong> Your gesture beats the computer’s.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lose:</strong> Your gesture is beaten by the computer’s.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tie:</strong> Both gestures are the same.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Play Again:</strong> In order to play again you just simply go ahead and select your next choice to play further normally.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Score Functionality:</strong> The game now includes a score system to track your performance. You earn <strong>+5 points</strong> for each win and <strong>no Negative points counting</strong> for each loss. The overall score is the sum of all these points, reflecting your cumulative performance across trials.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Auto Play:</strong> A new feature allows you to let a virtual player (representing you) automatically play the game against the computer. In this mode, the virtual player will randomly select gestures on your behalf, and the results will be calculated as if you were playing. The score and progress will be updated in your account as usual. This feature is useful if you want the game to run without manually choosing gestures.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Auto Play Button:</strong> The Auto Play feature comes with a dedicated button that acts as a switch. You can toggle Auto Play on and off by clicking the button. Once activated, the virtual player will keep playing the game until you turn the feature off by clicking the button again. This allows you to control when the Auto Play is running without any manual intervention.</li><br>
